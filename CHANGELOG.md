# Changelog

All notable changes to Macrotide are recorded here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Entries describe
shipped **capability** (not phase numbers — those go stale). Forward-looking
plans live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

Macrotide has not cut a release yet, so everything to date sits under
`[Unreleased]` as **Added** — there's no prior released version to mark things
`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Removed` against. The first public launch will be the first
cut: this section is sliced into a dated/versioned heading and a fresh
`[Unreleased]` starts above it, at which point those categories come into play.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Persistence layer** — SQLite + Drizzle (15 tables), daily rotating backups,
  full CRUD APIs, SWR fetchers; all seven screens read from the DB.
- **Passkey auth + demo mode** — better-auth + WebAuthn passkeys, secure-by-
  default gate (`AUTH_DISABLED=1` opt-out for local dev), per-session isolated
  in-memory demo databases routed via AsyncLocalStorage.
- **AI chat** — streaming `/api/chat` via the Vercel AI SDK + OpenRouter (one
  key, every major model), owner/demo provider routing, IP rate limit, security
  headers; chat history + thread-list sidebar with recency grouping and
  per-thread delete.
- **Advisor tool-calls** — read portfolio / plan / journal, write journal,
  propose plan edit, propose holding; capped tool loop; per-user scoped.
  **Proposal cards** (plan edits and holdings) that write through only on accept.
- **Portfolio analysis** — transparent 0–100 score (deterministic, from drift /
  fees / concentration / cash, with a per-component breakdown); the Plan &
  Health panel is driven by real signals (drift, blended TER, concentration,
  cash drag, rebalance hint).
- **Interactive charts** (recharts) with hover + tooltips.
- **Market data** — SET + global indices and FX (Yahoo); **Thai fund NAVs +
  NAV history** (Thai SEC Open API) behind a provider registry +
  `holdings.quote_source` taxonomy; demo NAV history pre-seeded so charts render
  instantly.
- **RSS news aggregator** — curated long-horizon editorial feeds on the markets
  screen (parallel fetch, dedupe, 30-min cache, partial-failure resilience).
- **Portfolio import** — CSV upload, manual-entry ticker autocomplete (seed of
  known Thai funds + global indices, merged with the user's holdings), and
  **image OCR** (statement screenshot → raw transcription via an OpenRouter
  vision model, free → paid fallback). The Image tab can hand the transcription
  to the advisor, which proposes reviewable holding rows you accept or dismiss.
- **Holding sources** — tag where each holding is held with a free-text source
  (suggestions from your past sources + common Thai fund platforms); rename a
  source across all your holdings from Settings → Sources.
- **Long-term memory** — bitemporal `user_preferences`, memory tools, always-on
  system-prompt injection, Settings → Memory, chat sidebar (auto-title, 30-day
  trash). Plus session lifecycle (active/idle/archived), real-time session-close
  extraction of durable facts (incremental, watermarked), chat summarization at
  ~80% context, `recall_preferences`, and sidebar full-text search (FTS5).
  Guide: [docs/explanation/memory.md](./docs/explanation/memory.md).
- **Multi-user with per-user data isolation** — `user_id` on app tables with
  **fail-closed scoping** (each account sees only its own rows; built-ins opt
  in explicitly), per-user investment plans, owner backfill from `OWNER_EMAIL`,
  `requireUser()` on API routes; holdings are scoped through their owning bucket
  (ownership validated on read + write).
- **Identity providers** — Google + GitHub OAuth (env-gated; boots passkey-only
  with nothing set), post-OAuth passkey-registration prompt.
- **Quotas + tier gating** — `free` (free-model router only) vs `trusted`
  (owner model chain), daily token cap, per-user usage logging, limit UI.
- **Owner admin** — an owner-only screen (gated on `OWNER_EMAIL`, enforced
  server-side on every request) to list users and flip account tiers
  `free`↔`trusted`, replacing hand-written SQL; guarded against self-demote.
- **Sign-up gate** — Cloudflare Turnstile (dev-bypass when unset), wired auth
  rate limit, and an inline consent notice ("By continuing, you agree…") at
  account creation. `/legal/terms` + `/legal/privacy` are operator-configurable
  (name / contact / jurisdiction via env; nothing operator-specific committed).
- **Account page** — single "Sign in" section with passkeys (revoke, with a
  last-passkey lockout guard) named from their AAGUIDs, linked OAuth providers,
  usage, and sign-out everywhere.
- **Public signed-out landing page** for the shared link, with CTAs to sign in
  or try the demo.
- **Tooling baseline** — Biome (lint + format), GitHub Actions CI, Dependabot,
  git pre-commit hooks, Node 24.
