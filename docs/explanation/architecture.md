# Architecture

*Last updated: 2026-05-27*

How Macrotide is put together, and why it's shaped this way. For the working
rules an agent must follow when editing (the `withDb` contract, streaming
context re-entry, the `server-only` boundary), see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) —
this page builds the mental model those rules sit on.

## The shape: one process, local SQLite

Macrotide is **a single Next.js process talking to local SQLite files.** No
separate database service, no message broker, no cache layer. The smallest
viable deploy is one small VM with a reverse proxy for TLS.

This is a deliberate choice for a personal-scale app: it keeps operations
trivial, keeps latency low (in-process DB reads), and keeps the whole thing
comprehensible. The trade-offs — single-writer SQLite, no horizontal scaling,
in-memory rate limits — are acceptable until there are real users, and are
documented in [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) and
[deploy.md](../how-to/deploy.md).

### Two databases, split by lifecycle

The store is split along a lifecycle boundary into **app.db** (the system of
record — accounts, buckets, holdings, plans, journal, chat, preferences, market
indicators) and **market.db** (regenerable — fund catalog/fees/performance/
portfolio, feeder look-through, and the NAV/quote cache). A two-handle
`DbContext` ([lib/db/context.ts](../../lib/db/context.ts)) routes each query to
the right handle by domain (`getAppDb()` / `getMarketDb()`). **No FK or join
crosses the boundary** — `holdings` reaches market data only via the soft
`quote_source`+`ticker` cache key, resolved app-side.

Why split: **blast-radius isolation** (the nightly SEC crawl rewrites market.db
and can never endanger an account), **lean backups** (only app.db is precious,
so the backup is small and market.db is excluded), **credential-free dev clones**
(market.db re-crawls from public sources), and **demo-with-real-data** (a demo
session gets an isolated in-memory app.db but shares the real market.db
read-only, so it sees the same warm cache as real users). A one-time
`scripts/split-db.ts` migrates an existing combined DB.

```text

                                                   │
                                                   └──▶ OpenRouter (AI); FMP/EODHD/Twelve Data/Frankfurter/Yahoo + Thai SEC (market data)
```

## Layers

| Layer | Lives in | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **UI** | [components/](../../components) | Screens (Portfolio, Markets, Chat, Journal, Models, Connect, Settings, Account) and shared components. Client-rendered; never imports server-only code or mock data directly. |
| **Client data** | [lib/fetchers/](../../lib/fetchers) | SWR fetchers — the only way components reach the API. |
| **API** | [app/api/](../../app/api) | Route handlers. Validate, run inside `withDb`, call queries. See [api reference](../reference/api.md). |
| **Domain logic** | [lib/portfolio/](../../lib/portfolio), [lib/market/](../../lib/market), [lib/memory/](../../lib/memory), [lib/advisor/](../../lib/advisor), [lib/ai/](../../lib/ai) | Pure-ish helpers and integrations: analytics, market providers, memory, Advisor tools, model provider. |
| **Persistence** | [lib/db/](../../lib/db) | Drizzle client, [schema](../../lib/db/schema) (split app/market), the two-handle context, migrations, and all queries (`server-only`). |
| **Auth** | [lib/auth/](../../lib/auth) | better-auth singleton, session helpers, providers. |
| **Content** | [lib/static/](../../lib/static) | Editorial strings and placeholder analytics, shipped in the bundle. |

A strict boundary: **components never import `lib/db/queries/*` or
`lib/mock/data`.** They go through a fetcher → API route → query. Queries are
gated by `import "server-only"` because `better-sqlite3` is Node-native.

## Owner vs demo databases

The one piece of cleverness worth internalising. Macrotide serves two kinds of
traffic from the same code:

- **Owner** — the authenticated user; app data persists in `app.db` at `DB_PATH`.
- **Demo** — anyone who clicked *Try the demo*; gets a private, **in-memory**
  app.db seeded from [lib/mock/demo-seed.ts](../../lib/mock/demo-seed.ts), keyed
  by the `macrotide_demo` cookie, swept after 1h idle, capped at 10 chat turns.
  It **shares the real market.db** (read-write, like a real user), so demo charts
  use — and warm — the same fund/index cache as real users (no per-session
  re-fetch; market data is global, so demo writes are just shared cache fills).

`withDb` ([lib/api/with-db.ts](../../lib/api/with-db.ts)) reads the demo cookie
and opens an `AsyncLocalStorage` scope so every `getDb()` call inside it routes
to the right app.db automatically. **Any route that queries must run inside
`withDb`**, or demo writes would leak into the owner DB.

The subtle case: `streamText`'s `onFinish` callback fires *after* `withDb`
returns, so the chat route captures the context and re-enters it with
`runWithDbContext`. This pattern is mandatory for any deferred write — the
canonical example is [app/api/chat/route.ts](../../app/api/chat/route.ts), and
the rule is spelled out in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#streaming--callbacks--re-enter-the-context).

## Request lifecycle (a typical read)

1. A screen renders and its SWR fetcher GETs an API route.
2. The route handler wraps its body in `withDb`, which resolves owner-vs-demo
   from the cookie.
3. Inside, it calls a query from `lib/db/queries/*`, which runs against the
   scoped SQLite.
4. JSON comes back; SWR caches it and the component renders.

Writes follow the same path with POST/PATCH/DELETE and revalidation.

## The chat path

`POST /api/chat` is the most involved route:

1. Resolve the model provider by tier and demo status ([lib/ai/provider.ts](../../lib/ai/provider.ts)).
   Free/demo traffic is pinned to the free model chain in code so it can never
   resolve to a paid model.
2. Inject the user's active memory into the system prompt
   ([lib/memory/inject.ts](../../lib/memory/inject.ts)), frozen for the session.
3. Stream the response with the Advisor's tool surface available
   ([lib/advisor/tools.ts](../../lib/advisor/tools.ts), [lib/memory/tools.ts](../../lib/memory/tools.ts)) —
   reading portfolio/plan/journal, proposing plan edits, saving preferences.
4. On finish (re-entering the DB context), persist the turn, meter usage, and —
   on session close — extract durable facts into memory.

The full memory + session-lifecycle design is its own document:
[features/memory.md](./memory.md).

## Market data

Holdings carry a `quote_source` routing key. A provider **registry**
([lib/market/registry.ts](../../lib/market/registry.ts)) dispatches NAV/price
fetches to the matching provider, with a cache layer in front. The routing key
names the *asset class*, not the provider, so swapping a provider only touches
the registry. Adding one is a documented four-step recipe in
[AGENTS.md § Provider routing](../../AGENTS.md#provider-routing-via-holdingsquote_source).

For index/FX/stock symbols (the `yahoo` source) the registry tries a **graceful
chain**: FMP and EODHD (keyed; **real** index levels where a free source exists)
→ Twelve Data (keyed; ETF proxies) → Frankfurter (keyless; FX) → Yahoo (keyless
fallback). The keyed providers drop out when their env var is unset, so the app
degrades from real levels → ETF proxy → Yahoo with no config; this is what fixed
Yahoo's datacenter-IP 429s. The chain is detailed in
[auth-and-providers.md](../reference/auth-and-providers.md#market-data-providers-indices--fx--stocks).
Thai mutual-fund NAVs come from the Thai SEC Open API.

## Fund search

The fund finder typeahead is served by an **in-memory MiniSearch index**
([lib/search/fund-index.ts](../../lib/search/fund-index.ts)) over the bounded,
read-only fund catalog — not a `LIKE` scan or a search server. It gives fuzzy +
prefix matching with field boosting and curated index-nickname synonyms, and
**folds each feeder fund's master fund name into the document** so "S&P500"
surfaces feeder funds like KKP US500-UH. The index builds lazily per market.db
handle and rebuilds transparently when a cheap staleness signal (active-fund
count + `MAX(updated_at)`) changes after the nightly refresh.

## Client UI state: typed external stores

Cross-component UI signals that aren't server data (e.g. the Portfolios
panel↔screen handshake, Chat UI events) go through small typed
`useSyncExternalStore` stores in [lib/stores/](../../lib/stores) — replacing the
earlier ad-hoc `window`-event buses. The store is the single source of truth, is
type-checked end to end, and integrates cleanly with React's concurrent
rendering (no manual event wiring or stale-closure hazards).

## Where it lives

A quick index from concept to code (reciprocates the `see docs/...` comments in
the source):
