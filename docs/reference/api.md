# API routes

Catalogue of the Next.js App Router route handlers under
[`app/api/`](../../app/api). This is a hand-maintained map; the route files
themselves are the source of truth for exact request/response shapes.

> **Convention.** Every handler that reads or writes the database runs inside
> `withDb`, which routes the query to the owner DB or the per-session demo DB
> based on the `macrotide_demo` cookie. See
> [architecture § owner vs demo databases](../explanation/architecture.md#owner-vs-demo-databases)
> and [AGENTS.md § DB routing](../../AGENTS.md#db-routing--read-this-before-touching-any-route-handler).
