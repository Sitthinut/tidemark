# AGENTS.md

Project-specific rules for AI agents working on this repo.

> **Documentation map.** This file is your rules + canonical env-var table. For
> everything else — architecture, the data model, the API surface, feature deep
> dives — the guide lives in [docs/](./docs), with [llms.txt](./llms.txt) as a
> machine-readable entry point. Load progressively: `llms.txt` →
> [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md) → the one section you need. When you change
> behavior, update the doc that owns that fact in the same commit (see below).

## Source of truth for "what's done"

[README.md](./README.md#status) holds the capability/status board (what works
today); [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) holds shipped detail by capability;
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) is forward-looking only (Now / Next / Later). When
you ship or change anything user-visible:

1. Add a one-line entry under `## [Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md),
   described by capability — not "yesterday", not a phase number.
2. Flip the matching row in the [README.md](./README.md#status) status board if
   its status changed, and move the item out of [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) if it
   was listed as planned.
3. If you change env vars, update [deploy.md](./docs/how-to/deploy.md),
   [auth-and-providers.md](./docs/reference/auth-and-providers.md), and `.env.example` together. Never one without the
   others.
4. If you change auth / security posture, update [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
5. If you add, move, rename, or repurpose a doc, update its line in
   [llms.txt](./llms.txt) (the agent-facing doc map) so the link and its
   one-line description still match. It tracks the docs *map*, not every code
   change — only touch it when the set or purpose of docs shifts.

Stale docs are the #1 failure mode here. After implementing, do a docs pass
before committing — treat docs as part of the change, not a follow-up.

## Personal data — never commit

This is a personal investing app. Do **not** put any of the following in
committed code, fixtures, tests, or docs:

- Real Thai fund codes the owner actually holds (use generic placeholders like
  `EXAMPLE-FUND-A`).
- Broker / fund-house brand names beyond what's already in editorial content.
- Email addresses, account names, real portfolio sizes, real cost basis.
- Any third-party private-company product names where embedding their identity
  could imply endorsement or violate TOS (e.g., commercial fund supermarkets).
  Reference only public, official data sources (Thai SEC, Yahoo Finance,
  exchange-published indices).

Tests use synthetic data only. If you need a real fund code to test against,
ask the user — never invent one and commit it as if it were real.

## DB routing — read this before touching any route handler

The database is split along a lifecycle boundary into two SQLite files:

- **app.db** (`DB_PATH`, default `data/app.db`) — system of record: accounts,
  buckets, holdings, plans, journal, models, chat, preferences,
  `user_market_indicators`. Precious; backed up nightly (`lib/db/backup.ts`).
  Accessed via `getAppDb()` (alias `getDb()`).
- **market.db** (`MARKET_DB_PATH`, default `data/market.db`) — regenerable
  market data: fund catalog/fees, fund enrichment, feeder look-through, and the
  NAV/quote cache (`nav_history`/`fund_quotes`). Rebuilt from upstream; NOT
  backed up. Accessed via `getMarketDb()`.

No FK or SQL join crosses the boundary. `holdings` links to market data only
via the soft `quoteSource`+`ticker` cache key resolved in app code
(`getCachedSeries`), never a join. A query module touching both (e.g.
`lib/db/queries/series.ts`) reads each handle and joins app-side. The schema is
split into `lib/db/schema/app.ts` + `lib/db/schema/market.ts`, re-exported from
`lib/db/schema/index.ts`. Two drizzle configs (`drizzle.config.{app,market}.ts`)
generate baselines under `lib/db/migrations/{app,market}/`.

Every API route that calls `getDb()`/`getMarketDb()` (which most queries do via
[lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries)) MUST run inside `withDb`. The wrapper
reads the `macrotide_demo` cookie and opens an AsyncLocalStorage scope that
routes the query to the right handles (owner singletons vs per-session demo
in-memory app.db; the market handle is always the shared real market.db).

```ts
// app/api/foo/route.ts
import { withDb } from "@/lib/api/with-db";
import { listSomething } from "@/lib/db/queries/something";

export async function GET() {
  return withDb(async () => {
    const rows = await listSomething();
    return Response.json(rows);
  });
}
```

### Streaming + callbacks — re-enter the context

`streamText`'s `onFinish` callback fires **after** `withDb` returns. You must
capture the context and re-enter it manually, or demo writes will land in the
owner DB. See `app/api/chat/route.ts` for the canonical pattern:

```ts
return withDb(async (ctx) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model,
    messages,
    onFinish: ({ text }) => {
      runWithDbContext(ctx, () => appendMessage(threadId, "assistant", text));
    },
  });
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
});
```

### Server-only

`better-sqlite3` is Node-native. Queries live in
[lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries), gated by `import "server-only"`. Never
import a query from a client component — go through a fetcher.

## Demo mode

- Visitors who click "Try the demo" on `/login` get a `macrotide_demo` cookie.
- Each session gets a private in-memory **app.db** seeded from
  [lib/mock/demo-seed.ts](./lib/mock/demo-seed.ts) (buckets/holdings/plan/
  journal/models — no market data). Market reads go to the SHARED real
  market.db, read-only: on a cache miss `cache.ts` fetches live but does NOT
  persist, so demo prices against real NAVs without writing the shared file.
- 1h idle TTL, hard cap 200 concurrent. Sweep runs on every request.
- Chat is capped at 10 turns server-side (defends OpenRouter budget).
- Demo state is intentionally ephemeral — never persist demo data to disk.

Test the demo path whenever you touch `/api/chat`, `/api/plan`, or any route
that takes a write.

## Where things live (avoid common mistakes)

| Kind | Lives in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Editorial content (markets explainers, learn articles, AI personalities) | [lib/static/](./lib/static) | Code-resident strings; ship in the bundle. |
| Placeholder analytics (ANALYSIS scores etc.) until AI tool-calls land | [lib/static/analysis.ts](./lib/static/analysis.ts) | Returns nulls / "—". Components render placeholder text. |
| Pure helpers (plan-edit, plan-parser) | [lib/portfolio/](./lib/portfolio) | Unit-testable; no DB / network. |
| User state (buckets, holdings, plan, journal, chat) | [lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries) via `withDb` | Owner vs demo routed automatically. |
| Mock seeds | [lib/mock/seed.ts](./lib/mock/seed.ts), [lib/mock/demo-seed.ts](./lib/mock/demo-seed.ts) | NEVER imported by components. |
| Shared types | [lib/static/types.ts](./lib/static/types.ts) | Domain types shared across components and adapters. |

**Components MUST NOT import from `@/lib/mock/data`.** Verify with
`grep -rn 'from "@/lib/mock/data"' components/` — should return zero hits.

## Provider routing via holdings.quote_source

Every holding has a `quote_source` column (NOT NULL, default `"yahoo"`)
that the market registry uses to dispatch NAV / price fetches:

| `quote_source` | Provider chain (in order) | Ticker shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"thai_mutual_fund"` | Thai SEC Open API | bare proj_abbr_name or share-class (`K-FIXED-A`, `HIDIV-D`) |
| `"yahoo"` | FMP → EODHD → Twelve Data → Frankfurter (FX) → Yahoo | bare/dotted/caret symbols (`^GSPC`, `^SET.BK`, `AAPL`, `PTT.BK`, `THB=X`) |

For `"yahoo"`, `lib/market/cache.ts` walks the chain (`resolveProviderChain`)
and uses the first provider that returns data — preferred source first, keyless
fallbacks last. The full precedence for a real-index symbol:

- **FMP** (`FMP_API_KEY`, free ≈ 250/day) — REAL US index levels for `^GSPC` /
  `^NDX` / `^DJI`. First because it has the most generous quota.
- **EODHD** (`EODHD_API_KEY`, free ≈ 20/day) — REAL global index levels via the
  `{CODE}.INDX` notation, including markets FMP's free tier lacks: Nikkei
  (`^N225`→`N225.INDX`) and the Thai **SET** index (`^SET.BK`→`SET.INDX`). Also
  `GSPC.INDX` / `NDX.INDX` / `IXIC.INDX` / `DJI.INDX`.
- **Twelve Data** (`TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY`, free ≈ 800/day) — the **ETF-proxy**
  layer: raw index symbols aren't on its free plan, so it maps each index symbol
  to its tracking ETF (`^GSPC`→SPY, `^NDX`→QQQ, `^DJI`→DIA, `^SET.BK`→THD, …).
- **Frankfurter** (keyless, ECB) — FX pairs (`THB=X`) only.
- **Yahoo** (keyless) — last resort; 429s datacenter IPs.

Each provider only matches the symbols it actually serves, and the keyed ones
drop out when their env var is unset. **Graceful degradation:** with the FMP/
EODHD keys UNSET, those providers' `matches()` return false and the chain is
exactly the prior behaviour — Twelve Data ETF proxy → Frankfurter → Yahoo — so
nothing breaks before those keys exist. The catalog (`lib/market/indicators.ts`)
uses REAL index canonical symbols (`^GSPC`, `^NDX`, `^DJI`, `^N225`, `^SET.BK`)
where a real source exists. **MSCI ACWI has no free real index anywhere and
stays an ETF proxy (`ACWI`); Gold stays the XAU/USD spot commodity (`GC=F`).**
The daily Markets cron fetches each indicator once/day — well inside every free
quota (FMP 250/day, EODHD 20/day, Twelve Data 800/day, Frankfurter unmetered).

**The value names the asset class, not the provider.** `"thai_mutual_fund"`
means "Thai mutual fund regardless of which API serves it." If we ever swap
the underlying provider, only the registry's routing map changes — holdings
stay valid.

The user-visible ticker stays bare (`K-FIXED-A`, not `thfund:K-FIXED-A`).
Routing lives in a separate column so it doesn't leak into UI labels,
search input, or imported CSV rows. See `lib/market/sources.ts` for the
constants + UI label map.

When adding a new provider:

1. Add the new source value to `QUOTE_SOURCES` in `lib/market/sources.ts`
   (use the asset class name — `"crypto"`, `"bond"`, `"fx"`, never the
   provider's name).
2. Implement a Provider with `matches(source, ticker)` returning true for
   that source.
3. Register it ahead of Yahoo in `lib/market/registry.ts`.
4. Add a UI label for the type selector in HoldingSheet.

Internal cache keys in `fund_quotes.ticker` and `nav_history.ticker` are
the combined `${source}:${ticker}` so the same table can hold quotes for
different sources without a schema change.

## Auth conventions

- `AUTH_DISABLED=1` opt-out for trusted local dev only. Default is
  auth-required.
- `AUTH_SECRET` is mandatory in production; throws on boot if unset.
- Multi-user mode adds a nullable `user_id` to app tables (migration `0007`).
  A signed-in owner's rows are stamped with their id; demo and built-in rows
  stay `NULL` (shared). Pre-multi-user rows start `NULL`.
- `OWNER_EMAIL` — names the owner account. The
  [backfill script](./scripts/backfill-owner.ts) attaches those `NULL`-owned
  rows to it and grants `trusted`; at runtime [lib/auth/owner.ts](./lib/auth/owner.ts)
  uses it to identify the owner for the admin UI (fail-closed — unset → nobody
  is owner). **Keep it in the running app's env, not just for the one-off
  script.** Run the script once after migrating.

## Environment variables

**Canonical reference** for every `process.env.*` the app reads. Operator
setup hints live in [.env.example](.env.example) (a thin template); the
authoritative behavior, defaults, and code locations are below. Keep this
table in sync when adding/renaming vars and also update
[.env.example](.env.example), [auth-and-providers.md](./docs/reference/auth-and-providers.md), and
[deploy.md](./docs/how-to/deploy.md) where they reference specifics.

### AI / model selection

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — (required for live AI) | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts), [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Chat returns a stub response without it; OCR returns 503. |
| `AI_MODELS` | `openrouter/free,openrouter/auto` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Comma-separated owner-chat fallback chain. First model is primary. |
| `DEMO_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | falls back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Separate key for demo traffic so demo can't burn owner quota. |
| `DEMO_AI_MODELS` | `openrouter/free` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Demo-chat model chain. Free-only by default. |
| `TITLE_MODEL` | `openrouter/free` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Cheap model for auto-titling a chat after its first turn pair (`POST /api/chat/threads/[id]/title`). **Never pin a Claude or GPT model here** — titling is a 3–5-word task and any non-mainstream free model (DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 small, etc.) is more than enough. Comma-separated chain accepted; first model is primary. |
| `OCR_MODEL` | `baidu/qianfan-ocr-fast:free` | [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Image OCR primary. Free tier; 27.2M tokens/week quota. Operator-verified no-train (re-verify before public deploy). |
| `OCR_FALLBACK_MODEL` | `baidu/qianfan-ocr-fast` (only when `OCR_MODEL` is unset) | [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Auto-retry on quota / rate-limit. Pinning `OCR_MODEL` disables the default fallback unless this is set explicitly. |

### Auth (better-auth)

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | dev fallback (`macrotide-dev-secret-change-me`) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | REQUIRED in production (boot throws if `NODE_ENV=production` and unset). |
| `AUTH_DISABLED` | unset | [app/page.tsx](./app/page.tsx), [lib/auth/session.ts](./lib/auth/session.ts), [lib/api/with-db.ts](./lib/api/with-db.ts) | Set to `1` to skip the login gate on trusted local dev only. |
| `AUTH_RP_NAME` | `Macrotide` | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Passkey relying-party display name. |
| `AUTH_RP_ID` | inferred from `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Override only if you understand WebAuthn `rpID` rules. |
| `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` (implicit) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts), [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Canonical URL. Used for OpenRouter `HTTP-Referer` and WebAuthn origin. Changing this in prod breaks existing passkeys. |
| `OWNER_EMAIL` | unset (no owner) | [scripts/backfill-owner.ts](./scripts/backfill-owner.ts), [lib/auth/owner.ts](./lib/auth/owner.ts) | Names the owner account. The backfill attaches `NULL`-owned rows to it + grants `trusted`; at runtime it identifies the owner for the admin UI (gate is **fail-closed** — unset → nobody is owner). **Must be in the running app's env, not just for the one-off script.** Run `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/backfill-owner.ts` once after migrating. Idempotent. |

### Auth — OAuth + signup gate

All optional and **env-gated**: with none set, the app runs passkey-only and the
`/login` page hides the OAuth buttons / Turnstile widget. A provider counts as
"enabled" only when BOTH its id and secret are present.

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Enables "Continue with Google" (needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` too). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Server-only. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Enables "Continue with GitHub" (needs `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` too). |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Server-only. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | unset | [lib/auth/turnstile.ts](./lib/auth/turnstile.ts), [/api/auth-config](./app/api/auth-config/route.ts) | **PUBLIC** — shipped to the browser to render the widget. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | unset | [lib/auth/turnstile.ts](./lib/auth/turnstile.ts) | Server verifies the signup/OAuth token here. **When unset, verification is BYPASSED (dev pass).** OAuth callback URIs for both providers must point at `<PUBLIC_APP_URL>/api/auth/callback/{google,github}`. |

Rate limiting: `/api/auth/*` POSTs are IP-limited via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`
(10/min/IP — [lib/api/rate-limit.ts](./lib/api/rate-limit.ts)), wired in
[app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts](./app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts).

### Legal pages

All optional and operator-configurable so the repo ships nothing
operator-specific; `/legal/terms` + `/legal/privacy` read them at render.

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OPERATOR_NAME` | unset → "a single individual" / "the operator" | [lib/legal/config.ts](./lib/legal/config.ts) | Who runs this instance, shown on both legal pages. |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | unset → no email, just "contact the operator" | [lib/legal/config.ts](./lib/legal/config.ts) | Contact shown (as a `mailto`) on both pages. **No fallback to `OWNER_EMAIL`** — set this only to publish a real address. |
| `LEGAL_JURISDICTION` | unset → governing-law clause omitted | [lib/legal/config.ts](./lib/legal/config.ts) | Governing-law jurisdiction (e.g. `Thailand`). |

The "Last updated" date is the `LEGAL_LAST_UPDATED` constant in
[lib/legal/config.ts](./lib/legal/config.ts) (bump it when editing the copy, not
an env var). Sign-up consent is an inline notice under the create-account button
("By continuing, you agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy"), not a checkbox.

### Database

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_PATH` | `data/app.db` | [lib/db/client.ts](./lib/db/client.ts), [lib/mock/seed.ts](./lib/mock/seed.ts) | app.db (system of record) path. Relative paths resolved from CWD; parent dir auto-created. |
| `MARKET_DB_PATH` | `data/market.db` | [lib/db/client.ts](./lib/db/client.ts) | market.db (regenerable market data) path. Same `data/` volume as app.db; not backed up. |

### Quotas + tier gating

Per-user metering only applies to **authenticated** requests. Single-owner /
`AUTH_DISABLED` mode (`getUserId()` === null) is never metered, and demo
sessions are bounded by the demo turn cap, not these budgets.

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_FREE` | `20000` | [lib/db/queries/usage.ts](./lib/db/queries/usage.ts) | Daily input+output token cap per `tier='free'` user. Checked before forwarding to OpenRouter; resets at UTC midnight. Malformed/≤0 → default. |
| `DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_TRUSTED` | `200000` | [lib/db/queries/usage.ts](./lib/db/queries/usage.ts) | Same, for `tier='trusted'` users. |

The free-tier **model chain** is pinned to `openrouter/free` in code
([lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) `resolveTierProvider`) and is
deliberately NOT derived from `AI_MODELS` — a free user can never resolve to a
paid model regardless of operator config. `tier='trusted'` uses the `AI_MODELS`
owner chain. Tier is stored in `account_tier`; promote via SQL
(`UPDATE account_tier SET tier='trusted' WHERE user_id=?`).

### External data sources

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SEC_API_KEY` | — (Thai funds render as "—" without it) | [lib/market/providers/sec-thailand.ts](./lib/market/providers/sec-thailand.ts) | Thai SEC Open API subscription key (Primary or Secondary — both valid). Header: `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. Covers all 6 product groups under one subscription. |
| `FMP_API_KEY` | — (chain falls through to EODHD → ETF proxy → Yahoo) | [lib/market/providers/fmp.ts](./lib/market/providers/fmp.ts) | Financial Modeling Prep. REAL US index levels for `^GSPC`/`^NDX`/`^DJI` via `/api/v3/historical-price-full`. Free tier ≈ 250 req/day — first in the `yahoo` chain for the US indices it covers. Matches only those symbols + only when set. |
| `EODHD_API_KEY` | — (chain falls through to ETF proxy → Yahoo) | [lib/market/providers/eodhd.ts](./lib/market/providers/eodhd.ts) | EOD Historical Data. REAL global index levels via `{CODE}.INDX` (e.g. `GSPC.INDX`, `NDX.INDX`, `N225.INDX`, **`SET.INDX`** for Thailand). Free tier ≈ 20 req/day — second in the chain; covers Nikkei + SET that FMP's free tier lacks. Matches only mapped index symbols + only when set. |
| `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY` | — (falls back to keyless Yahoo, which 429s from datacenter IPs) | [lib/market/providers/twelvedata.ts](./lib/market/providers/twelvedata.ts) | ETF-proxy layer for `yahoo`-sourced series (Markets indicators, FX, stocks). When set, used after FMP/EODHD; maps index symbols to tracking ETFs (SPY/QQQ/DIA/THD/…) since raw index symbols aren't on the free plan. Free tier ≈ 800 req/day, 8 req/min. ACWI stays an ETF; Gold stays XAU/USD. |

### Dev-only

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CODEX_AUTH_FILE` | OS-default Codex auth path | [lib/ai/codex.local.ts](./lib/ai/codex.local.ts) | Path to a Codex CLI auth JSON file, used by the local-codex integration during development. Test-only outside of dev. |
| `DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | unset (localhost only) | [next.config.ts](./next.config.ts) | One extra origin added to Next's `allowedDevOrigins` so the dev server trusts a non-localhost host (reverse proxy, Codespaces, LAN IP, tunnel). Hostname only, no scheme. No effect on prod builds. |

### Framework

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` (set by Next.js / build tooling) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Gates the `AUTH_SECRET` requirement and cookie `secure` flag. |

## Build, lint, test

```bash
npm run dev        # hot reload at :3000
npm run build      # production build (typechecks everything)
npm run lint       # Biome check
npm run format     # Biome --write
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # vitest
npm run smoke:sec -- <FUND-CODE>          # smoke-test Thai SEC provider (needs SEC_API_KEY)
```

Pre-commit hook (simple-git-hooks + lint-staged) runs Biome on staged files.
**Never** commit with `--no-verify` — if the hook fails, fix the issue.

GitHub Actions CI runs typecheck + lint + build. The build step needs
`AUTH_SECRET` injected (already wired in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Migrations (Drizzle)

- Schema lives in [lib/db/schema/](./lib/db/schema) — `app.ts` (app.db) +
  `market.ts` (market.db), re-exported from `index.ts`. Put a new table in the
  file matching its lifecycle (precious → app, regenerable → market).
- Generate migrations with `npm run db:generate` (runs both
  `db:generate:app` + `db:generate:market`). Each DB has its own config
  (`drizzle.config.{app,market}.ts`) and migration dir
  (`lib/db/migrations/{app,market}/`). Migrations are forward-only; in dev,
  prefer `db:drop:app`/`db:drop:market` + reseed over hand-editing.
  The FTS5 `chat_messages_fts` table (not expressible in drizzle) rides as a
  hand-written custom migration on the app baseline.
- Migrations run on boot in [lib/db/client.ts](./lib/db/client.ts) for both
  handles. Demo DBs replay the APP baseline only on session create (market is
  the shared real DB).
- Adding a column to an app table? Most app tables already carry a nullable
  `user_id` (migration `0007`) for per-user scoping; design new ones the same way.

## Product copy & vocabulary

These are durable rules for user-facing copy in macrotide. Apply them
when writing UI strings, toasts, banners, page titles, button labels, or
chat-system prompts — anywhere a user sees words.

**Voice:** formal and friendly. Plain English over jargon. No emojis in
product copy unless the user explicitly asks.

**The AI is "Advisor".** Never "agent", "bot", "assistant", or "AI" in
running copy. Page titles, system prompts, marketing pages all use
"Advisor". Internal/code identifiers (variable names, DB enum values
like `source = 'advisor_tool'`, log lines) follow the same convention.

**Persistent disclaimer.** Below the chat input on every session, a
single muted line:

> *Advisor is AI and can make mistakes.*

That exact phrasing — not paraphrased — is the project-wide AI-warning
copy. Reuse it verbatim anywhere else a similar disclaimer is needed.
Not dismissible; not a banner.

**Memory / chat-session vocabulary** (full table in
[docs/explanation/memory.md](./docs/explanation/memory.md)):

| Concept | Use | Don't use |
|---|---|---|
| Session state after 7-day idle | "Archived" | "Wrapped up", "Compressed" |
| In-progress chat summarization | "Summarizing…" | "Compressing…" |
| Auto-extracted preferences | "notes" | "facts", "memories" |
| Soft-deleted chat | "Deleted chats" (with 30-day restore) | "Trash" alone |

**Timestamps:** store UTC, render in the user's IANA timezone. Timezone
itself is a `profile`-category preference in `user_preferences` (set
default from the browser; let the user override on the Settings page).

## When in doubt

- For "where do I put X?" — check the table above.
- For "is this in scope?" — check [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Stay within the
  current "Now" work; don't expand into "Next"/"Later". Record anything you
  notice in the relevant section or the "Out of scope" notes.
