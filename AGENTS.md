# AGENTS.md

Project-specific rules for AI agents working on this repo.

> **Documentation map.** This file is your rules + canonical env-var table. For
> everything else — architecture, the data model, the API surface, feature deep
> dives — the guide lives in [docs/](./docs), with [llms.txt](./llms.txt) as a
> machine-readable entry point. Load progressively: `llms.txt` →
> [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md) → the one section you need. When you change
> behaviour, update the doc that owns that fact in the same commit (see below).

## Source of truth for "what's done"

[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) is the single index of feature status. When you ship
or change anything user-visible:

1. Update [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) — the "Phases at a glance" table and the
   relevant phase section. Use the commit hash, not "yesterday".
2. Update [README.md](./README.md) "Status" block if it mentions the area.
3. If you change env vars, update [deploy.md](./docs/how-to/deploy.md),
   [auth-and-providers.md](./docs/reference/auth-and-providers.md), and `.env.example` together. Never one without the
   others.
4. If you change auth / security posture, update [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

Stale docs are the #1 failure mode here. After implementing, do a docs pass
before committing — treat docs as part of the change, not a follow-up.

## Personal data — never commit

This is a personal investing app. Do **not** put any of the following in
committed code, fixtures, tests, or docs:

- Real Thai fund codes the owner actually holds (use generic placeholders like
  `EXAMPLE-FUND-A`).
- Broker / fund-house brand names beyond what's already in editorial content.
- Email addresses, account names, real portfolio sizes, real cost basis.
- Any third-party private-company product names where embedding their identity
  could imply endorsement or violate TOS (e.g., commercial fund supermarkets).
  Reference only public, official data sources (Thai SEC, Yahoo Finance,
  exchange-published indices).

Tests use synthetic data only. If you need a real fund code to test against,
ask the user — never invent one and commit it as if it were real.

## DB routing — read this before touching any route handler

Every API route that calls `getDb()` (which most queries do via
[lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries)) MUST run inside `withDb`. The wrapper
reads the `macrotide_demo` cookie and opens an AsyncLocalStorage scope that
routes the query to the right SQLite (owner singleton vs per-session demo
in-memory).

```ts
// app/api/foo/route.ts
import { withDb } from "@/lib/api/with-db";
import { listSomething } from "@/lib/db/queries/something";

export async function GET() {
  return withDb(async () => {
    const rows = await listSomething();
    return Response.json(rows);
  });
}
```

### Streaming + callbacks — re-enter the context

`streamText`'s `onFinish` callback fires **after** `withDb` returns. You must
capture the context and re-enter it manually, or demo writes will land in the
owner DB. See `app/api/chat/route.ts` for the canonical pattern:

```ts
return withDb(async (ctx) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model,
    messages,
    onFinish: ({ text }) => {
      runWithDbContext(ctx, () => appendMessage(threadId, "assistant", text));
    },
  });
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
});
```

### Server-only

`better-sqlite3` is Node-native. Queries live in
[lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries), gated by `import "server-only"`. Never
import a query from a client component — go through a fetcher.

## Demo mode

- Visitors who click "Try the demo" on `/login` get a `macrotide_demo` cookie.
- Each session gets a private in-memory SQLite seeded from
  [lib/mock/demo-seed.ts](./lib/mock/demo-seed.ts).
- 1h idle TTL, hard cap 200 concurrent. Sweep runs on every request.
- Chat is capped at 10 turns server-side (defends OpenRouter budget).
- Demo state is intentionally ephemeral — never persist demo data to disk.

Test the demo path whenever you touch `/api/chat`, `/api/plan`, or any route
that takes a write.

## Where things live (avoid common mistakes)

| Kind | Lives in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Editorial content (markets explainers, learn articles, AI personalities) | [lib/static/](./lib/static) | Code-resident strings; ship in the bundle. |
| Placeholder analytics (ANALYSIS scores etc.) until AI tool-calls land | [lib/static/analysis.ts](./lib/static/analysis.ts) | Returns nulls / "—". Components render placeholder text. |
| Pure helpers (plan-edit, plan-parser) | [lib/portfolio/](./lib/portfolio) | Unit-testable; no DB / network. |
| User state (buckets, holdings, plan, journal, chat) | [lib/db/queries/](./lib/db/queries) via `withDb` | Owner vs demo routed automatically. |
| Mock seeds | [lib/mock/seed.ts](./lib/mock/seed.ts), [lib/mock/demo-seed.ts](./lib/mock/demo-seed.ts) | NEVER imported by components. |
| Shared types | [lib/static/types.ts](./lib/static/types.ts) | Domain types shared across components and adapters. |

**Components MUST NOT import from `@/lib/mock/data`.** Verify with
`grep -rn 'from "@/lib/mock/data"' components/` — should return zero hits.

## Provider routing via holdings.quote_source

Every holding has a `quote_source` column (NOT NULL, default `"yahoo"`)
that the market registry uses to dispatch NAV / price fetches:

| `quote_source` | Provider | Ticker shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"thai_mutual_fund"` | Thai SEC Open API | bare proj_abbr_name or share-class (`K-FIXED-A`, `HIDIV-D`) |
| `"yahoo"` | Yahoo Finance | bare/dotted/caret symbols (`^SET.BK`, `AAPL`, `PTT.BK`, `THB=X`) |

**The value names the asset class, not the provider.** `"thai_mutual_fund"`
means "Thai mutual fund regardless of which API serves it." If we ever swap
the underlying provider, only the registry's routing map changes — holdings
stay valid.

The user-visible ticker stays bare (`K-FIXED-A`, not `thfund:K-FIXED-A`).
Routing lives in a separate column so it doesn't leak into UI labels,
search input, or imported CSV rows. See `lib/market/sources.ts` for the
constants + UI label map.

When adding a new provider:

1. Add the new source value to `QUOTE_SOURCES` in `lib/market/sources.ts`
   (use the asset class name — `"crypto"`, `"bond"`, `"fx"`, never the
   provider's name).
2. Implement a Provider with `matches(source, ticker)` returning true for
   that source.
3. Register it ahead of Yahoo in `lib/market/registry.ts`.
4. Add a UI label for the type selector in HoldingSheet.

Internal cache keys in `fund_quotes.ticker` and `nav_history.ticker` are
the combined `${source}:${ticker}` so the same table can hold quotes for
different sources without a schema change.

## Auth conventions

- `AUTH_DISABLED=1` opt-out for trusted local dev only. Default is
  auth-required.
- `AUTH_SECRET` is mandatory in production; throws on boot if unset.
- Multi-user mode adds a nullable `user_id` to app tables (migration `0007`).
  A signed-in owner's rows are stamped with their id; demo and built-in rows
  stay `NULL` (shared). Pre-multi-user rows start `NULL`.
- `OWNER_EMAIL` — read only by [scripts/backfill-owner.ts](./scripts/backfill-owner.ts),
  not at runtime — names the account that inherits those `NULL`-owned rows and
  is granted the `trusted` tier. Run the script once after migrating.

## Environment variables

**Canonical reference** for every `process.env.*` the app reads. Operator
setup hints live in [.env.example](.env.example) (a thin template); the
authoritative behavior, defaults, and code locations are below. Keep this
table in sync when adding/renaming vars and also update
[.env.example](.env.example), [auth-and-providers.md](./docs/reference/auth-and-providers.md), and
[deploy.md](./docs/how-to/deploy.md) where they reference specifics.

### AI / model selection

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — (required for live AI) | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts), [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Chat returns a stub response without it; OCR returns 503. |
| `AI_MODELS` | `openrouter/free,openrouter/auto` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Comma-separated owner-chat fallback chain. First model is primary. |
| `DEMO_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | falls back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Separate key for demo traffic so demo can't burn owner quota. |
| `DEMO_AI_MODELS` | `openrouter/free` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Demo-chat model chain. Free-only by default. |
| `TITLE_MODEL` | `openrouter/free` | [lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) | Cheap model for auto-titling a chat after its first turn pair (`POST /api/chat/threads/[id]/title`). **Never pin a Claude or GPT model here** — titling is a 3–5-word task and any non-mainstream free model (DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 small, etc.) is more than enough. Comma-separated chain accepted; first model is primary. |
| `OCR_MODEL` | `baidu/qianfan-ocr-fast:free` | [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Image OCR primary. Free tier; 27.2M tokens/week quota. Operator-verified no-train (re-verify before public deploy). |
| `OCR_FALLBACK_MODEL` | `baidu/qianfan-ocr-fast` (only when `OCR_MODEL` is unset) | [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Auto-retry on quota / rate-limit. Pinning `OCR_MODEL` disables the default fallback unless this is set explicitly. |

### Auth (better-auth)

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | dev fallback (`macrotide-dev-secret-change-me`) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | REQUIRED in production (boot throws if `NODE_ENV=production` and unset). |
| `AUTH_DISABLED` | unset | [app/page.tsx](./app/page.tsx), [lib/auth/session.ts](./lib/auth/session.ts), [lib/api/with-db.ts](./lib/api/with-db.ts) | Set to `1` to skip the login gate on trusted local dev only. |
| `AUTH_RP_NAME` | `Macrotide` | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Passkey relying-party display name. |
| `AUTH_RP_ID` | inferred from `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Override only if you understand WebAuthn `rpID` rules. |
| `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` (implicit) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts), [lib/portfolio/ocr.ts](./lib/portfolio/ocr.ts) | Canonical URL. Used for OpenRouter `HTTP-Referer` and WebAuthn origin. Changing this in prod breaks existing passkeys. |
| `OWNER_EMAIL` | unset (script no-op) | [scripts/backfill-owner.ts](./scripts/backfill-owner.ts) | **Script-only, not read at runtime.** Names the account that inherits `NULL`-owned rows and gets the `trusted` tier. Run `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/backfill-owner.ts` once after migrating. Idempotent. |

### Auth — OAuth + signup gate

All optional and **env-gated**: with none set, the app runs passkey-only and the
`/login` page hides the OAuth buttons / Turnstile widget. A provider counts as
"enabled" only when BOTH its id and secret are present.

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Enables "Continue with Google" (needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` too). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Server-only. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Enables "Continue with GitHub" (needs `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` too). |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | [lib/auth/providers.ts](./lib/auth/providers.ts) | Server-only. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | unset | [lib/auth/turnstile.ts](./lib/auth/turnstile.ts), [/api/auth-config](./app/api/auth-config/route.ts) | **PUBLIC** — shipped to the browser to render the widget. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | unset | [lib/auth/turnstile.ts](./lib/auth/turnstile.ts) | Server verifies the signup/OAuth token here. **When unset, verification is BYPASSED (dev pass).** OAuth callback URIs for both providers must point at `<PUBLIC_APP_URL>/api/auth/callback/{google,github}`. |

Rate limiting: `/api/auth/*` POSTs are IP-limited via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`
(10/min/IP — [lib/api/rate-limit.ts](./lib/api/rate-limit.ts)), wired in
[app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts](./app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts).

### Database

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_PATH` | `data/app.db` | [lib/db/client.ts](./lib/db/client.ts), [lib/mock/seed.ts](./lib/mock/seed.ts) | SQLite file path (relative paths resolved from CWD). Parent dir auto-created. |

### Quotas + tier gating

Per-user metering only applies to **authenticated** requests. Single-owner /
`AUTH_DISABLED` mode (`getUserId()` === null) is never metered, and demo
sessions are bounded by the demo turn cap, not these budgets.

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_FREE` | `20000` | [lib/db/queries/usage.ts](./lib/db/queries/usage.ts) | Daily input+output token cap per `tier='free'` user. Checked before forwarding to OpenRouter; resets at UTC midnight. Malformed/≤0 → default. |
| `DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_TRUSTED` | `200000` | [lib/db/queries/usage.ts](./lib/db/queries/usage.ts) | Same, for `tier='trusted'` users. |

The free-tier **model chain** is pinned to `openrouter/free` in code
([lib/ai/provider.ts](./lib/ai/provider.ts) `resolveTierProvider`) and is
deliberately NOT derived from `AI_MODELS` — a free user can never resolve to a
paid model regardless of operator config. `tier='trusted'` uses the `AI_MODELS`
owner chain. Tier is stored in `account_tier`; promote via SQL
(`UPDATE account_tier SET tier='trusted' WHERE user_id=?`).

### External data sources

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SEC_API_KEY` | — (Thai funds render as "—" without it) | [lib/market/providers/sec-thailand.ts](./lib/market/providers/sec-thailand.ts) | Thai SEC Open API subscription key (Primary or Secondary — both valid). Header: `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. Covers all 6 product groups under one subscription. |

### Dev-only

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CODEX_AUTH_FILE` | OS-default Codex auth path | [lib/ai/codex.local.ts](./lib/ai/codex.local.ts) | Path to a Codex CLI auth JSON file, used by the local-codex integration during development. Test-only outside of dev. |
| `DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | unset (localhost only) | [next.config.ts](./next.config.ts) | One extra origin added to Next's `allowedDevOrigins` so the dev server trusts a non-localhost host (reverse proxy, Codespaces, LAN IP, tunnel). Hostname only, no scheme. No effect on prod builds. |

### Framework

| Var | Default | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` (set by Next.js / build tooling) | [lib/auth/index.ts](./lib/auth/index.ts) | Gates the `AUTH_SECRET` requirement and cookie `secure` flag. |

## Build, lint, test

```bash
npm run dev        # hot reload at :3000
npm run build      # production build (typechecks everything)
npm run lint       # Biome check
npm run format     # Biome --write
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # vitest
npm run smoke:sec -- <FUND-CODE>          # smoke-test Thai SEC provider (needs SEC_API_KEY)
```

Pre-commit hook (simple-git-hooks + lint-staged) runs Biome on staged files.
**Never** commit with `--no-verify` — if the hook fails, fix the issue.

GitHub Actions CI runs typecheck + lint + build. The build step needs
`AUTH_SECRET` injected (already wired in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Migrations (Drizzle)

- Schema lives in [lib/db/schema.ts](./lib/db/schema.ts).
- Generate migrations with `npm run db:generate`. Migrations are forward-only;
  in dev, prefer `drizzle-kit drop` + reseed over hand-editing past
  migrations.
- Migrations run on boot in [lib/db/client.ts](./lib/db/client.ts). Demo DBs
  replay the same migrations on session create.
- Adding a column to an app table? Most app tables already carry a nullable
  `user_id` (migration `0007`) for per-user scoping; design new ones the same way.

## Product copy & vocabulary

These are durable rules for user-facing copy in macrotide. Apply them
when writing UI strings, toasts, banners, page titles, button labels, or
chat-system prompts — anywhere a user sees words.

**Voice:** formal and friendly. Plain English over jargon. No emojis in
product copy unless the user explicitly asks.

**The AI is "Advisor".** Never "agent", "bot", "assistant", or "AI" in
running copy. Page titles, system prompts, marketing pages all use
"Advisor". Internal/code identifiers (variable names, DB enum values
like `source = 'advisor_tool'`, log lines) follow the same convention.

**Persistent disclaimer.** Below the chat input on every session, a
single muted line:

> *Advisor is AI and can make mistakes.*

That exact phrasing — not paraphrased — is the project-wide AI-warning
copy. Reuse it verbatim anywhere else a similar disclaimer is needed.
Not dismissible; not a banner.

**Memory / chat-session vocabulary** (full table in
[docs/explanation/memory.md](./docs/explanation/memory.md)):

| Concept | Use | Don't use |
|---|---|---|
| Session state after 7-day idle | "Archived" | "Wrapped up", "Compressed" |
| In-progress chat summarization | "Summarizing…" | "Compressing…" |
| Auto-extracted preferences | "notes" | "facts", "memories" |
| Soft-deleted chat | "Deleted chats" (with 30-day restore) | "Trash" alone |

**Timestamps:** store UTC, render in the user's IANA timezone. Timezone
itself is a `profile`-category preference in `user_preferences` (set
default from the browser; let the user override on the Settings page).

## When in doubt

- For "where do I put X?" — check the table above.
- For "is this in scope?" — check [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) phase boundaries.
  Don't expand scope to cover the next phase; record what you noticed in the
  phase's "Risk" or "Out of scope" section.
- For "should I commit?" — only when the user has authorized. See workspace
  [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the git posture rule.
