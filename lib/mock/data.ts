// ===== User Plan (free-form markdown brief, edited in place) =====
export const USER_PLAN: UserPlan = {
  markdown: `## Target
Bogleheads 3-Fund: 50% US equity (SCBS&P500), 30% International (K-WORLDX), 20% Thai Bonds (K-FIXED).
Open to advisor's suggestion if there's a better fit.

## Principles
- Low fees first — TER under 0.7% blended.
- Global diversification over home bias.
- Boring works. I don't want to think about this weekly.
- No active funds. Index only.

## Risk
Comfortable with 20% drawdowns. 30% would make me nervous but I won't sell.
I want a portfolio I can hold through anything.

## Commitments
- I will rebalance toward Bogleheads 3-Fund by end of May.
- I will sell down KFGBRAND-A (too expensive, overlaps).
- I will only review when drift > 7pp, not weekly.
- I won't buy individual stocks or crypto.

## Open questions
- Should I tilt more toward emerging markets?
- Is dollar-cost averaging worth it if my contributions are irregular?

## Contributions
No regular schedule — lump sums when I have extra cash.
Probably ~฿15-30k every few months.`,
