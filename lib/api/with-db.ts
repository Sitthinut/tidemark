/**
 * Resolve a per-request DB context. An **authenticated session always wins**:
 * if a user is logged in we route to the owner app.db scoped to their id and
 * ignore any lingering `macrotide_demo` cookie. Only when there is NO
 * authenticated user AND a demo cookie is present do we route the app handle to
 * that session's isolated in-memory SQLite. Otherwise the owner singletons.
 *
 * The market handle (fund catalog + NAV/quote cache) is the SHARED real
 * market.db in every case — including demo, which uses it read-write like a real
 * user (reads + write-through cache fills; see lib/market/cache.ts), so a symbol
 * fetched once serves every later session. A demo session thus sees REAL market
 * data while its own buckets/holdings/plans stay isolated in its in-memory app.db.
 *
 * For owner requests we carry the authenticated user id on the context so
 * per-user query scoping (lib/db/queries/scope.ts) applies. `userId` is null in
 * single-owner / `AUTH_DISABLED` mode, which makes scoping collapse to the
 * legacy `user_id IS NULL` set — behavior is identical to single-owner mode.
 * Demo sessions are already isolated, so they stay `userId: null`.
 *
 * Wrap every route handler that touches the DB with this so demo sessions
 * remain isolated.
